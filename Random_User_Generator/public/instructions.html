    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Understand how to use JSON, map(), and props. <br />
      Bonus: refactor the app using useState and useEffect.
    </p>
    <h2>To do</h2>

    <h3>Level 1</h3>
    <ol start="0">
      <li>
        You are given a JSON file (<code>users.json</code>) containing mock data
        about some random users. This file is already imported at the top of you
        <code>App.js</code>
        and contains data that is ready to be used. Your first task is to open
        this JSON file and see how the data is structured.
      </li>
      <li>
        For each user contained inside this JSON file, create a component
        <code>&lt;User&gt;</code> (thanks to

          target="_blank"
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map"
          >map()</a
        >) and pass all the data from the user as <strong>props</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Inside the <code>&lt;User&gt;</code> component, pass the rest of the
        data to the <code>&lt;Contact&gt;</code> component.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>

          >spread operator</a
        >
        to pass the props.</em
      >
    </p>
    <h3>Level 2</h3>
    <ol start="0">
      <li>
        When you are finished with level 1 and everything works as expected;
        refactor your application so that you don't use mock data from the JSON
        file anymore, but "live" data coming from an API. For this, we are going
        to use the <strong>RandomUser</strong> API. Try to read up the
        <a href="https://randomuser.me/documentation" target="_blank">
          documentation
        </a>
        and understand how the API works
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a React Hook (useState); build a state that will accomodate the
        users you are going to query
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a React Hook (useEffect) + Fetch, query the correct endpoint (<a
          href="https://randomuser.me/documentation#multiple"
          target="_blank"
          >hint</a
        >) that will return 10 random users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the data you map upon from the mock data to the data you fetched
        from the API. Thanks for the fact that the data is shaped the same way;
        you should not see any difference and your app should work the same!
        Because fetch is an asynchronous operation, make sure you prevent the
        map() to run until <i>after</i> the data has been successfuly set in the
        state (<a

          target="_blank"
          >hint</a
        >)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Level 3 (optional)</h3>
    <ol start="0">
      <li>
        To play around with the API; create 3 buttons in the App.js file. One
        button should say "<strong>Show only Men</strong>", the other "<strong
          >Show only Women</strong
        >", and the third "<strong>Show both</strong>". Find a way to
        conditionaly pass a gender parameter to the endpoint you're calling.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Level 4 (optional)</h3>
    <ol start="0">
      <li>
        Create a dropdown select menu (<a
          href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#the-select-tag"
          target="_blank"
          >hint</a
        >) that will allow you to choose how many users are returned by the API
      </li>
    </ol>
